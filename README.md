# This is the repository for my HCP graph analysis
1. Find overweight, obese, and normal weight non-twins
2. FSLnets to assess differences in ICA derived networks
3. Use graph metrics to assess the connectivity of the ICA networks
4. I have also started a datalad to store my intermediate pickle files in case of a crash.
